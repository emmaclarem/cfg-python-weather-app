## About
This is my final project for the Code First Girls Python & Apps Kickstarter course, built in collaboration with my teammate [Nicolette Bell](https://github.com/nicolettebell).  
Team Duck! 🦆🦆🦆

## The project must:
- [x] Accept a city name as input from the user
- [x] Allow user to specify a country if there are multiple cities with the same name
- [x] Sanitize user input 
- [x] Convert user input string into latitude and longitude
- [x] Make a request to the API with the requested location's latitude and longitude as part of the search query
- [x] Get the returned values from the API response
- [x] Display the weather from the inputted location

## The project should:
- [x] Covert weather code into real weather value as a string
- [x] Be a reusable function so it can be re-run to get multiple locations without ending and restarting 
- [x] Handle user inputs that are not a real city/country or are gibberish
- [x] Handle inputs to the Y/N questions that aren't Y or N

## The project could:
- [ ] Have a web-based visual interface for input and to display the weather data
- [x] Allow a 'random' request to pull any city
- [x] Have ducks? 🦆
